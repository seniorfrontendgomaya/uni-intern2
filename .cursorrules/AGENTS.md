## Student role – navigation header & Internship megamenu

- **Navbar:** Shared navbar (`src/components/shared/navbar.jsx`) shows "Internships" and "Courses" for all users (including student role). Student sees the same header; login only affects whether "Internships" / "Courses" are direct links or open the login modal.
- **Internship megamenu:** Rendered when the user hovers "Internships" (desktop) or taps it (mobile). Component: `src/components/shared/helper/internships-megamenu.jsx`. Import: `InternshipsMegaMenu` from `./helper/internships-megamenu`. It is used inside the "Internships" dropdown in the navbar (around line 358). On desktop, the megamenu is shown when `internshipsOpen` is true (mouse enter/leave). On mobile (`isMobile`), the megamenu can be passed `onClose` for closing.
- **API integration:** The megamenu does not use role-specific APIs. It calls four public GET endpoints on mount (and when `activePaid` changes): `top_locations/`, `top_profile/`, `top_catgory/`, `top_placement_courses/`. Base URL: `https://inter.malspy.com`. No auth headers. Response shape: `{ data: Array }`; each item has at least `name`. All links go to `/internships?<query>` with `job_type` = active filter (paid | both | unpaid) plus the relevant filter (location, designation, category, or course). When a link is clicked, the code checks `localStorage` token; if missing, it dispatches `open-login-modal` instead of navigating. Keep this behavior when changing the megamenu or navbar.
